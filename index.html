FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) image compression is a lossless compression technique used to reduce the size of images while preserving their quality.

FFT compression is based on the principle that natural images have most of their energy concentrated in the lower frequency range, while higher frequencies contain less important details.

The compression process involves converting the image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using the FFT algorithm. This transformation represents the image as a combination of different frequency components.

In the frequency domain, the high-frequency components (representing fine details) can be discarded or reduced, resulting in a smaller representation of the image.

By applying a threshold or selecting a subset of the frequency coefficients, FFT compression eliminates high-frequency information and retains the lower-frequency components, effectively reducing the image size.

One advantage of FFT compression is its ability to achieve high compression ratios without significant loss of visual quality, making it suitable for applications where preserving image fidelity is crucial.

FFT compression is commonly used in medical imaging, satellite imaging, and other applications where precise representation and analysis of images are required.

The decompression process involves converting the compressed frequency domain representation back to the spatial domain using the inverse FFT (IFFT) algorithm, reconstructing the image.

Since FFT compression is a lossless technique, the reconstructed image is an exact replica of the original image, ensuring no loss of information during compression and decompression.

While FFT compression excels in preserving image quality, it may not achieve as high compression ratios as lossy compression techniques. In scenarios where storage space is a major concern, lossy compression methods may be more suitable.</p1>
